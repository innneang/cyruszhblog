As of July 2022, I changeed my Twitter handle to @CyrusZhang99 in order to make it more spellable by English speaker.

Why ?

Ealier this year, I have a chat with @Scomma and @BowKraivanich
 about starting a group of Thai building in public but after a while I realeized that I have never seen one Thai who build in public other than @narze Svelte challenge. I once sent a group invitation to friends of builder in facebook but only 1-2 people accepted my invite. Moreorver, I asked Tony Dinh for an adivice and he suggest tweeting and making content in English to reach larger audiences.

**27 of July 2022**, I started tweeting about starting my new app in Twitter. 

I will jot down my journey daily into this blog.
